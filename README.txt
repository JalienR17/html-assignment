Knowledge Check  | HTML Content

OVERVIEW: This assignment will assess your understanding of the HTML concepts covered in Module 4. Youâ€™ll practice working with essential HTML elements, 
such as forms, tables, navigation bars, and images.

INSTRUCTIONS: In VS Code, please complete the following tasks in a .html file. You can include a css stylesheet if you would like. 

Create a New HTML Page:
Start with a basic HTML5 structure:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Module 4 HTML Assignment</title>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Your code goes here -->
</body>
</html>

Part 1: Form Creation
Create a Basic Contact Form with the following fields:
Name (text input)
Email (email input)
Message (textarea)
Submit button
Bonus: Add a radio button group asking how the user found the site (e.g., Google, Social Media).

Part 2: Table Structure
Create a Table that displays some sample product data:
Columns: Product Name, Price, and Quantity.
Rows: At least 3 products with their respective details.
Bonus: Add a header row to label the columns.

Properly indent and organize your HTML code for readability.
Add comments to explain key sections where necessary.

Ensure the page is responsive by using the viewport meta tag.

Save your completed .html file, ensuring it is correctly named and follows HTML5 standards.
If your assignment includes additional assets (e.g., images, CSS files), include them in a properly structured folder.
Create a README.txt file that briefly describes the assignment and the key components you implemented.
Bonus Consideration:
Clearly label any bonus components in your code with comments to make them easy to identify.
Submission:
Upload your .html file(s) (along with any additional assets) directly to Google Classroom as a .zip file or individual files as needed.
